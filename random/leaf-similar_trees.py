# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:

# Given a tree, the leaves form a certain order from left to right. Two trees are considered "leaf-similar" if their leaf orderings are the same.

# For instance, the following two trees are considered leaf-similar because their leaves are [2, 1]:
#     3
#    / \ 
#   5   1
#    \
#     2 
#     7
#    / \ 
#   2   1
#    \
#     2 
# Our job is to determine, given two trees, whether they are "leaf similar."
