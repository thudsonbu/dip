# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:

# Given a list of points, an interger k, and a point p, find the k closest points to p.

# Here's an example and some starter code:

class Point:
  def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  def __repr__(self):
    return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

import heapq


class Point:
  def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y

  def __repr__(self):
    return f"({self.x}, {self.y})"

  # Doesn't matter which value is greater, first tuple value should
  # determine the ordering.
  def __gt__(self, p):
    return True


def point_dist_squared(p1, p2):
  return (p1.x - p2.x)**2 + (p1.y - p2.y)**2


def closest_points(points, k, p):
  closest = []

  for point in points:
    dist = point_dist_squared(p, point)
    heapq.heappush(closest, (-dist, point))
    if len(closest) > k:
      heapq.heappop(closest)

  return [point for _, point in closest]


points = [
    Point(0, 0),
    Point(1, 1),
    Point(2, 2),
    Point(3, 3),
]


print(closest_points(points, 2, Point(0, 2)))
print(closest_points(points, 2, Point(0, 2)))
# [(0, 0), (1, 1)]
