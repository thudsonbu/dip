# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

# Reshaping a matrix means to take the same elements in a matrix but change the
# row and column length. This means that the new matrix needs to have the same
# elements filled in the same row order as the old matrix. Given a matrix, a
# new row size x and a new column size y, reshape the matrix. If it is not 
# possible to reshape, return None.

# Here's an example and some starter code.

def reshape_matrix(mat, x, y):
  if len(mat) * len(mat[0]) != x * y:
    return None

  new_mat = [[0] * x for _ in range(y)]

  i = 0
  j = 0
  for row in mat:
    for cell in row:
      new_mat[i][j] = cell

      j += 1

      if j >= x:
        i += 1
        j = 0

  return new_mat


print(reshape_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 1, 4))

print(reshape_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2, 3))
