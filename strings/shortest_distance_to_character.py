# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Uber:

# Given a string s and a character c, find the distance for all characters in 
# the string to the character c in the string s. You can assume that the 
# character c will appear at least once in the string.

def shortest_dist(s, c):
  result = [float('inf')] * len(s)

  c_idx = float('inf')
  for idx, ch in enumerate(s):
    if ch == c:
      c_idx = idx
      result[idx] = 0
    elif c_idx != float('inf'):
      result[idx] = idx - c_idx

  c_idx = float('inf')
  for idx, ch in reversed(list(enumerate(s))):
    if ch == c:
      c_idx = idx
      result[idx] = 0
    elif c_idx != float('inf'):
      result[idx] = min(result[idx], c_idx - idx)

  return result


print(shortest_dist('helloworld', 'l'))
# [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]
